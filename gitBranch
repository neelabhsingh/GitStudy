I created file testGit.text and then commit and push on github, Now github has file testGit.text.


1. git checkout -b neelabh_branch  => This will create new branch name neelabh_branch and switch to new branch.

2. git branch
  master
* neelabh_branch
Now on local repository we have two branch but on github we have onle one branch master.

3. Create file newFile.txt, under branch neelabh_branch, and commit then push to github.
But you will get message: Everything up-to-date, and GitHub only shows one file testGit.txt, which was pushed from origin. But on local repository will show two files 1. testGit.txt, 2. newFile.txt

3. Push the branch on github : 
git push origin neelabh_branch

Now on github you can see two branch master and neelabh_branch. 

4.Add a new remote for your branch :
git remote add master https://github.com/neelabhsingh/GitStudy

5.
